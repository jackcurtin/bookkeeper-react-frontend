# Bookkeeper
This app allows users to log their book collection, while simultaneously helping develop our growing database. Users
can create new entries for books, authors, publishers, and genres. If any of those fields already exist in the database,
they can utilize entries that already exist.

#### User Stories
As a user, I should be able to...
* browse the public book listings without logging in.
* use the search box in the Navbar to look for book, author, publisher, or genre listings by keyword.
* create and account / log in if I already have one.
* add existing books to my collection.
* create new listings for books that are not in the database yet.
* add books to my list of favorites.
* see the latest additions to the database.
* see a randomized book selection refreshed daily.
* add the daily book selection to my collection if it is not already there.

#### Personal Journey
The back-end for this app was developed during a pair-programming project with Bharti Gupta during our Software
Engineering Immersive course with General Assembly. This front end specifically was undertaken as a project after 
graduating from the course as a way to become more comfortable with using React. Coming from and Angular background,
the general concept of React was clear to me but it's specific syntax/workflow was something I needed to get used to.

#### Resources
This was as much a learning experience as it was a mission to provide a high-quality front-end to a back-end only
project I wanted to showcase. Without any formal training in React, I learned a lot from the following two videos
* [Programming with Mosh - Intro to React](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke90Tje7VS0)
* [Brian Design - React Beginner Tutorial with Responsive Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2UBjN5ER4s)
